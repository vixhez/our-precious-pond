# Our Precious Pond

Our Precious Pond is a MERN stack application all about the almighty duck. With a focus on conservation, this application informs the user about their duck alter-ego upon completion of a set of questions to (lightly) gauge the user's personality. Following this is information about the calculated duck alter-ego species, as well as the opportunity to view other ducks within the database serving the app. Duck-related conservation resources are also available on the app.

The conscious decision has been made to ensure that all ducks featured in the app are of some level of concern in terms of conservation - this felt like an important angle to the project and creates a powerful and compelling contrast of emotion to ultimately score ducks and duck conservation issues a more prominent place in people's hearts.
